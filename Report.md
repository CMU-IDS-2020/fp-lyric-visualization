Our application has three visualizations:
1. **Word Similarities** presents a 2-D scatter plot of the T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE) on a word basis. The words from the two songs are combined into one data set for processing, but are presented on the scatter plot in different colors, with the words from the left song as green points and the words from the right song as purple points. The intent of this visualization is to display the similarity of the vocabularies of the songs in a meaningful way. Among possible insights, this visualization reveals if the two songs use many of the same exact words or if they use different words that have very similar meanings. Words that are closer to each other on the plot are more similar. In testing we found that words with the same part of speech or word type (e.g. pronouns, contractions) were often close together and words with shared thematic elements (e.g. life, death) were often close together. The interactions with this plot include hovering over a point to see a tooltip of the word associated with the point, clicking a point to highlight in orange the associated word in the two songs, brushing over a set of points in order to highlight in orange all of their associated words in the two songs, and clicking on words in either of the songs in order to highlight in blue their associated points in the scatter plot.
2. **Line Similarities** presents a 2-D scatter plot of the T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE) on a line basis. The lines from the two songs are combined into one data set for processing, but are presented on the scatter plot in different colors, with the lines from the left song as green points and the lines from the right song as purple points. The intent of this visualization is to display the similarity of the lyrics of the two songs. Among possible insights, this visualization reveals if there are variations of the same phrase being used within or between songs and if the meaning of the lines are similar enough that they could be mistaken (by this model) as being from one song. In testing we found examples where the unexpected occurred: two songs with very different origins whose plotted points overlapped and two songs where one sampled the other and their points were clearly separate. The interactions with this plot include hovering over a point to see a tooltip of the line associated with the point, clicking a point to highlight in orange the associated line in the two songs, brushing over a set of points in order to highlight in orange all of their associated lines in the two songs, and clicking on lines in either of the songs in order to highlight in blue their associated points in the scatter plot.
3. **Positivity** presents the positivity of the songs in two ways. It shows a heat map next to the lyrics of each song with a red square indicating that a line is negative and a green square indicating that a line is positive. It also shows a bar plot of the positivity of the words vs. the positivity of lines plotting the percentages of four categories of words in each song: positive words in positive lines (pos_word_pos_line), negative words in negative lines (neg_word_neg_line), positive words in negative lines (pos_word_neg_line), and negative words in positive lines (neg_word_pos_line). The left song's bars are green and the right song/s bars are purple. The positivity of the words and lines is calculated by inputting each word and each line into the HuggingFace Library's sentiment-analysis classifier. Though the value returned from the classifier includes a label (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE) and a confidence measure on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, we found in testing that the classifier was usually very confident (0.9-1.0). For this reason, we decided to present the positivity as a discrete quantity to the user. In our first prototype we had a scatter of word positivity vs. line positivity and found it to interesting to see when the sentiment of a line didn't match with the sentiment of a word. We wanted to keep the opportunity for this insight, and decided to display the combinations in a bar plot, normalized to percentages to account for the situation where one of the songs has many more words than the other. The interactions with this plot include clicking on one of the song's bars in order to highlight all of the words that match its label in that song.

Two case studies:
1. Using our application to compare *Step To My Girl* by Souls of Mischief and *Step* by Vampire Weekend, Danny Brown illustrated the usefulness of the word similarity and line similarity visualizations. In both, the points are highly overlapping. Though we saw overlapping in the word similarity plot for other song pairs, this was one of the few pairs for which there was also overlapping in the line similarity plot. What's so interesting about this pairing is that the two songs aren't covers of the same song - they have no shared origin story - and yet they are very similar. For instance, in *Step To My Girl* there is a line "Catch crazy glares when I'm with female company" and in *Step* there is a line "Every time I'm with her, dudes always wanna stare." In the line similarity plot the points for these two lines are very close together. These lines mean the same thing, but are said in two different ways. In the word similarity plots there are many pairs of points close together. For example, the words "make" and "sees" from *Step To My Girl* and "made" and "seen" from *Step* are all near each other in the plot. These points illustrate that *Step To My Girl* is speaking in the present tense whereas *Step* is speaking in the past tense. Interacting with these similarity plots allowed us to interpret what is shared among the songs - by words and by lines - and to make our own judgements about where the similarities end and the meanings of the songs are different.
2. Using our application to compare *Just the Two of Us* by Will Smith and *Just the Two of Us* by Grover Washington Jr. illustrated the usefulness of the positivity visualization. Will Smith's song samples Grover Washington Jr.'s for the chorus, but where Grover Washington Jr.'s depicts a romantic relationship, Will Smith's depicts a father-son relationship. In examining the positivity bar plot, we saw that both of the songs are overwhelming positive. About 65% of Will Smith's song are positive words in positive lines and about 80% of Grover Washington Jr.'s song are positive words in positive lines. The heat map shows that the negative lines are distributed throughout each song rather than being grouped together. By selecting the negative words in negative lines, we saw that in both cases there were one or two negative words in a negative line that influenced the line's classification. For instance, in Will Smith's song, words "death," "let," and "harm" are classified as negative in the negatively-classified line "I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm." Even though this line speaks about possible negative events, it could be interpreted as a positive sentiment because it demonstrates the speaker's value for their son's safety. Interacting with the positivity visualizations allowed us to get a broader understanding of how the words and lines could be classified individually, and allowed us to make our own judgements of the how the positivity of the songs change throughout their lyrics and of the positivity of the songs as a whole.
