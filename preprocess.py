# Name of File: preprocess.py
# Date: November 14th, 2020
# Purpose of File: to collect data about the words in a particular song from various sources
#                  and create two Panda dataframes: one that is by-location in the song (lyrics)
#                  and one that is by-word (dictionary)
# Tools used:
# LyricsGenius (see https://pypi.org/project/lyricsgenius/)
# TextBlob (see https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
# HuggingFace Library (https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html)
# Merriam-Webster (https://dictionaryapi.com/)

# Also make a dictionary Panda dataframe of the words that are in the song

# Use the TextBlob Library for each word
# Add the results to the dictionary Panda Dataframe

# Use the Huggingface Library for each word
# Add the results to the dictionary Panda Dataframe

# Use the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API for each word
# Add the results to the dictionary Panda Dataframe
