# Name of File: dictionary_preprocess.py
# Date: November 14th, 2020
# Purpose of File: to create a Panda dataframe called dict_dataframe that uses the lyrics dataframe from
#                  lyrics_preprocess.py, makes a dictionary of the words with their word counts, and
#                  looks up different dimensions of the words using the tools below
# Tools used:
# TextBlob (see https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
# HuggingFace Library (https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html)
# Merriam-Webster (https://dictionaryapi.com/)

# IDEA FOR LATER:
# If we expand this to a general-purpose interactive visualization (can enter many songs)
# We could use this library for parsing, including removing punctuation and correcting the spelling of words so that they are searchable

# IDEA FOR LATER:
# Pass lines into textblob (getting the polarity and subjectivity) to see if there are clear differences between lines
# Also do with the huggingface library [it's interesting that there are so many super postive and super negative labeled words]

# IDEA FOR LATER:
# Use TextBlob to get the similarity of every pair of words:
# Example from here: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#quickstart
# Guidance: 
# "You can also create synsets directly.
# from textblob.wordnet import Synset
# octopus = Synset('octopus.n.02')
# shrimp = Synset('shrimp.n.03')
# octopus.path_similarity(shrimp)
